# RobotC Stuff

Small repository for school projects involving ROBOTC.
Specifically for a CLAWBot.

## Master VS External-Functions-alt

Both are almost identical, however External-Functions-alt contains two additional files (allProg-of.c and of.c). of.c is required for allProg-of.c to work properly. I only did this to have a backup of the *-of.c files.

## How do you use any of this?
For starters, you need ROBOTC, mostly for the compiler, and a robot. From there it should be easy to understand. All these files were made at different points, which means the wiring is done differently, depending on the file. Due to this, all files should be considered standalone, and non-compatable with eachother.
